Description: # Infomap Software Package
        
        Infomap is a network clustering algorithm based on the
        [Map equation](http://www.mapequation.org/publications.html#Rosvall-Axelsson-Bergstrom-2009-Map-equation).
        
        For more info, see [www.mapequation.org](http://www.mapequation.org).
        
        
        Getting started:
        --------------------------------------------------------
        In a terminal with the GNU Compiler Collection installed,
        just run `make` in the current directory to compile the
        code with the included `Makefile`. Call `./Infomap` to run.
        
        Run `./Infomap --help` or visit [options](http://www.mapequation.org/code.html#Options)
        for a list of available options.
        
        Infomap can be used both as a standalone program and as a library.
        See the `examples` folder for examples.
        
        We also include an [IPython notebook](examples/python/infomap-examples.ipynb)
        with the examples that can be viewed online.
